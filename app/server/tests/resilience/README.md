# Resilience tests

Opt-in tests that exercise the server under adverse client and network behavior
(clients that stall, stop reading, or disconnect mid-request), and verify it
degrades gracefully and reclaims resources (connections, pooled DB clients,
memory) rather than leaking or crashing.

They boot the app in-process and drive it over real TCP, so they are **excluded
from `npm test`** and run only via `npm run test:resilience`.

Everything here drives the **local app over HTTP only**. Never point it at a
deployed or shared environment.

## Prerequisites

A reachable dev DB, configured via env (the devshell provides it). The tests
start the app in-process on an ephemeral port, so no separate server is needed.

## Run

```sh
npm run test:resilience
```

## Configuration

Override via env where needed:

| Var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_POOL_MAX` | `10` | pool size, from `.env.local` |
| `STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | `10000` | used by `streamIdleTimeout.test.js`; from `.env.local` |
| `RST_ITERATIONS` | `500` | aborted requests `clientDisconnect.test.js` fires |
| `RST_MAX_DELAY_MS` | `50` | upper bound on `clientDisconnect.test.js`'s post-send abort delay |
